# LosRios-primo-nde
NDE development environment for the four NDE views at the Los Rios Libraries. The development environment comes from the [Ex Libris-maintained NDE repository](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/customModule). For now, each view is a separate development environment instance. There is probably a better way to maintain multiple views and when we learn what that is, we'll reorganize the repository.

The libraries are initially migrating customizations from [their Primo VE views](https://github.com/Los-Rios-Libraries/Primo-VE-Views).

The repository is public to allow others to look at how the custom components are done, but please be aware that we are not professional developers and aspects of the components may be less than optimal. Obviously copying and adapting code is done at your own risk.

Live NDE views may not be fully synced to the repository while we are in the early stages of development. The Sacramento City College view is likely to include the most customizations until we go live. Links:
